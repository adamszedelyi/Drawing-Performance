# Drawing Performance

This is the companion app to my series on high performance drawing on iOS:

The goal of this app is to measure the performance of various drawing methods in iOS

You can freely draw on the canvas, or tap one of the buttons to let it draw a spiral for you

<i>Be sure to run this on a real device, as the performance readings on the simulator are not accurate. </i>
