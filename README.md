# Drawing Performance

This is the companion app to my series on high performance drawing on iOS:

- [High performance drawing on iOS - Part 1](https://medium.com/@almalehdev/high-performance-drawing-on-ios-part-1-f3a24a0dcb31)

- High performance drawing on iOS - Part 2 (coming soon)

The goal of this app is to measure the performance of various drawing methods in iOS

<i>Be sure to run this on a real device, as the performance readings on the simulator are not accurate. </i>
